# PendulumOscillatorForHeliumBalloon

This is a Demo-Plugin for HeliumBalloon to demonstrate how you can implement a Custom Oscillator using the BalloonOscillatorCreateEvent.
It adds a pendulum (like a children's swing) as oscillator.

In this example we use the "oscillatorHint" attribute of the rule to mark our custom oscillator.

Please adjust the coordinates in the config.yml to your need.
