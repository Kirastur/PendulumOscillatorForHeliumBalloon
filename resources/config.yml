# Welcome to the PendulumOscillatorForHeliumBalloon configuration settings
#
# This is a Demo-Plugin for HeliumBalloon
# to demonstrate how you can implement a Custom Oscillator
# by using the BalloonOscillatorCreateEvent.
# It adds a pendulum (like a children's swing) as oscillator.
#
# Get the HeliumBalloon plugin from
#   https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/heliumballoon.95902
#
#
# In this example we use a custom oscillator
#
# The following configuration is loaded as part of the Balloon Config.
# It offers a mincart loaded ith an emerald
#
# Please adjust the coordinates to your need.
